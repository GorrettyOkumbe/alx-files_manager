This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.<br>

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:<br>

User authentication via a token<br>
List all files<br>
Upload a new file<br>
Change permission of a file<br>
View a file<br>
Generate thumbnails for images<br>
You will be guided step by step for building it, but you have some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etc… (utils folder will be your friend)<br>

Of course, this kind of service already exists in the real life - it’s a learning purpose to assemble each piece and build a full product.<br>
